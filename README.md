## Overview
CS110L-sp20:  Safety in Systems Programming

[CS110L](https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020/) is focused on **safety and robustness in systems programming**: Where do things often go wrong in computer systems? How can we avoid common pitfalls? We will use the Rust programming language as a vehicle to teach mental models and paradigms that have been shown to be helpful in preventing errors, and we will look at how these features have made their way back into C++. The first three weeks will focus on preventing many of the types of problems that you encountered in CS 107: how can we prevent buffer overflows, memory leaks, use-after-free bugs, and other sorts of memory errors? Then, we will focus on preventing common mistakes that arise in the programming settings CS 110 covers: how do we write safe code when multiprocessing and multithreading are involved? Check out the [syllabus](https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020/handouts/course-material/) to see an overview of course material.

Outside of lecture, there will be small weekly programming exercises to help you reinforce the material; we expect these will take 1-3 hours to complete. In addition, there will be two projects throughout the quarter that will involve implementing something that you can be proud of. (Tentatively, the first project will involve implementing a simple version of gdb, and the second project will involve implementing a high-performance server.)
